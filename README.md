# stats

This is a node package that generates some stats about your Javascript project.

But really it's an experiment in how good ChatGPT is at writing code. All the files in this project (except this README) were generated by ChatGPT, with some minimal intervention to get it working as intended.

## Usage

You can probably install this locally and run it from npx or whatever, but I do it the lazy way...

    npm start -- <path of your project source>

Note that your current directory has to be the stats project directory for this to work. If you are in a different directory (probably your project's own) then you need to do this:

    npm start --prefix <path to stats source> -- <path of your project source>

Note that if you use relative paths then the first path is relative to your current directory, but the second one is relative to the directory where the stats source is. That's just the way npm works.
